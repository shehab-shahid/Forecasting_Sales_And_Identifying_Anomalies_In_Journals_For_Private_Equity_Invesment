# Forecasting_Sales_And_Identifying_Anomalies_In_Journals_For_Private_Equity_Invesment

* This project was part of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Private Equity (Data Analyst) course.
* A Private Equity firm is looking to invest in SuperStore, an international retailer that offers office supplies, furniture and technology. The firm wants to use Data Science to assess SuperStore's financial performance and management controls.
* The project used Python to identify any fraudulent or anomalous journal entries (PCA, clustering) and that segregation of duties in journals also exists
* The financial performance required forecasting sales and profits (using ARIMA) for the next five years to see if the net profit on sales increases by 10% annually and sales grow by 25% annually. Non-profitable regions also needed to be identified.
